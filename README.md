# TheCardGuardian

TheCardGuardian is a Discord Bot for MTG and YuGiOh! Trading Card Game.

## WARNING (PLEASE READ THIS FIRST)

TheCardGuardian is NOT a proper Discord bot (many bad practices, especially regarding the hotlinking of images). Use TheCardGuardian at your own risk.

TheCardGuardian is NOT designed to run on multiple servers, responding to multiple concurrent requests.

TheCardGuardian is a simple Discord bot for personal use for really small server, responding to requests once in a while.

It's a project I do in my free time. So think of this as a prototype. A simple working Discord bot, without the features and the scalability of bigger and more proper Discord bots.

You have been warned.

## Features

- Daily cards! (Select the channel and the time for TheCardGuardian to send the daily cards and you're golden!)

- Card search by name! (i.e. "Lazav, Familiar Stranger", or "Pot Of Greed", with the results being the information regarding the cards)

- Card search by query (multiple results)! (i.e. "Dark", with the results being every card that contains the word "Dark" in it's name)
